      <h3>Message from comittee</h3>
In 2 Cor 3:3 Paul makes us aware we are the letters of Christ, written by God with the Holy Spirit us the ink. 
This year youth camp seeks to explore what it means to be a <span class="highlight">"letter of Christ"</span> . 
Questions we seek to answer: What does it mean to authored by the Father? 
What does the word of God mean written with the ink of the Holy Spirit? 
If we are letters who have we been written to?
We seek to understand what it means to be God's Masterpiece, his own design and crafting.
We desire to truly live up to the great expectation God has for us, 
to fulfil our assignment both as individuals and as a church. 
We wish to practically manifest the desire of God for our generation(the readers).
In this camp we will look at who we are and not what we think we are,
pray and fast for the manifestation of our gifts and calling, 
christian excellence, targeting the mountains of our nation and a whole lot more.

      My first time in Accra Ridge Church Youth Camp was in 2012. Before my camp experience i knew God was now not just our God but our Father. The problem I had was identifying this fact in my everyday life. I had also gotten to a point where I thought I didn't deserve to be loved by God because I had little sins that kept pulling me down in my Christian faith. Camp changed all that. 
      It was a platform where I learnt the unadulterated truth about God's love for us and who he really is to us as a Father. My life from that time till date has never been the same. My walk with my heavenly Father has been more intimate and I see it reflecting in my everyday life.
      I still go to ARC youth Camps any time it happens and my knowledge in Christ and fellowship with the Holy Spirit keeps growing.

        Initially I wasn't planning on going for camp because I felt I'll be going through the usual routines. I ended up there anyway. ​I felt empty and felt like God was always so far away​. My prayer throughout camp was to develop a closer and more intimate relationship with God. I decided i would try and allow the Holy Spirit to take control at camp.
      Everyday I learnt something new. My prayers began to chane from the usual asking for things to prayers of intercession and even praise. Usually when asked to pray for someone, i find it very difficult, but that changed at camp. The more I prayed for people, the more compassion I began to feel. I believe God was teaching me How to love.
      At some point He started to speak through me, He seemed upset. He kept saying "Open up your hearts". it was a bit overwhelming. 
      All in all it was a great experience and it made me learn to love God more and know just how real He is.
