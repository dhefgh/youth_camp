      <h3>Message from comittee</h3>
        In 2 Cor 3:3 Paul makes us aware we are the letters of Christ, written by God with the Holy Spirit us the ink. 
        This year youth camp seeks to explore what it means to be a <span class="highlight">"letter of Christ"</span> . 
        Questions we seek to answer: What does it mean to authored by the Father? 
        What does the word of God mean written with the ink of the Holy Spirit? 
        If we are letters who have we been written to?
        We seek to understand what it means to be God's Masterpiece, his own design and crafting.
        We desire to truly live up to the great expectation God has for us, 
        to fulfil our assignment both as individuals and as a church. 
        We wish to practically manifest the desire of God for our generation(the readers).
        In this camp we will look at who we are and not what we think we are,
        pray and fast for the manifestation of our gifts and calling, 
        christian excellence, targeting the mountains of our nation and a whole lot more.

<p>      I remember immediately after finishing SHS I was at home and was stuck behind the TV. My
Christian life was not as smooth as I expected. By divine appointment (on hindsight) I decided to
try and chase after God. The youth fellowship announced that the camp for that year was to
evangelize to some communities in Amasaman. I joined although a bit begrudgingly, and went through the preparation
which included a series of prayer sessions as well as going through the
material to be used for the evangelism. 

It was meticulous and it was turened out to be extreemely helpfulon the field. I joined a day later than everyone else. Our leaders had planned a program which started with a movie show the people showed up and right from day one we had people giving their lives to Christ. The joy and their expressions on their faces was a sight to behold. The daily dawn broadcasts
were also a test of our determination and definitely a test of my Ga speaking skills. The opportunity to
share the word of God in my mother tongue was unique and refreshing; there is definitely no
experience better than praising God in our mother tongue. Later on in the day we would go and preach
the gospel to the communities and teach them about Christ. We would later go back and share our
clothing and goodies we had gathered from church members as well as a medical outreach. This
strategy worked well as we showed them that we were not only interested in their Spiritual welfare
but their holistic welfare as well.

The climax of the whole evangelism was the crusade. We prepared as usual excellently on all fronts.
We formed a wall of prayer around the crusade grounds and the program was hugely successful. Lots
of the inhabitants up until today are grateful for the fact that we shared Christ with them and
testimonies overflowed on our subsequent visits to the communities. I was greatly privileged to see
the hand of God and power of God move in the people I felt greatly privileged to have fulfilled the
great commission that Jesus asked His followers to do upon His leaving the earth.
My life was greatly impacted and I forever cherish the friendships I made and the privilege to impact
lives.
