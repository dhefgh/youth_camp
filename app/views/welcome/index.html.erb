      <h3>Message from committee</h3>
        This year, the Accra Ridge Church Youth Fellowship feel compelled to go out and share
everything we continue to receive year after year whenever we retreat and go and wait on
God. In actual fact, our theme last year for camp was Letters of Christ with the verse, 1
Corinthians 3:1-5 encouraged us to “show that you are a letter of Christ, the result of our
ministry written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but
on tablets of human hearts.”
It is with these teachings that the Accra Ridge Church Youth Fellowships have decided to
spend our camp days at Asofan, going out into the community and telling the inhabitants
about God’s love for us and His great gift to us. We would not like to go on our own and
would like to invite everyone in the church to come along with us. We are therefore working
with the Evangelism Committee as well as the 80 th Anniversary Committee in order to ensure
this desire is fulfilled.

<p>      I remember immediately after finishing SHS I was at home and was stuck behind the TV. My
Christian life was not as smooth as I expected. By divine appointment (on hindsight) I decided to
try and chase after God. The youth fellowship announced that the camp for that year was to
evangelize to some communities in Amasaman. I joined although a bit begrudgingly, and went through the preparation
which included a series of prayer sessions as well as going through the
material to be used for the evangelism. 

It was meticulous and it was turened out to be extreemely helpfulon the field. I joined a day later than everyone else. Our leaders had planned a program which started with a movie show the people showed up and right from day one we had people giving their lives to Christ. The joy and their expressions on their faces was a sight to behold. The daily dawn broadcasts
were also a test of our determination and definitely a test of my Ga speaking skills. The opportunity to
share the word of God in my mother tongue was unique and refreshing; there is definitely no
experience better than praising God in our mother tongue. Later on in the day we would go and preach
the gospel to the communities and teach them about Christ. We would later go back and share our
clothing and goodies we had gathered from church members as well as a medical outreach. This
strategy worked well as we showed them that we were not only interested in their Spiritual welfare
but their holistic welfare as well.

The climax of the whole evangelism was the crusade. We prepared as usual excellently on all fronts.
We formed a wall of prayer around the crusade grounds and the program was hugely successful. Lots
of the inhabitants up until today are grateful for the fact that we shared Christ with them and
testimonies overflowed on our subsequent visits to the communities. I was greatly privileged to see
the hand of God and power of God move in the people I felt greatly privileged to have fulfilled the
great commission that Jesus asked His followers to do upon His leaving the earth.
My life was greatly impacted and I forever cherish the friendships I made and the privilege to impact
lives.
