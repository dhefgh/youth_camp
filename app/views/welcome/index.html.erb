      <h3>Message from the Camp Committee</h3>

      A simple yet profound word-theme that encapsulates our connection first to God through Christ, and to one another: and therefore becomes the window through which we can view and learn the implications of this connectedness. 
      The goal is to become a better community of believers because of this.
We want Linked 2020 to bring focus on our shared journey as Christian brothers and sisters; we want it to focus on the  energising power of the Holy Spirit, the active consequences of love at work, and how all these lead to 
perfect unity which in turn creates a fertile garden where we all grow and mature.
We want Linked 2020 to center conversations of our trials and triumphs in building edifying relationships. We want it to be about looking out for the interest of others and providing the support they need to grow We want
it to be about generosity and everything that makes us competent community builders.
Our conviction is that anyone who comes to Linked 2020 will go away feeling deeply connected to Christ and to others!

THEME SCRIPTURE.
Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate? Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly 
with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose. Don’t be selfish; don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves. Don’t look out 
only for your own interests, but take an  interest in others, too. (Philippians 2:1‭-‬4 NLT)

<p>      I remember immediately after finishing SHS I was at home and was stuck behind the TV. My
Christian life was not as smooth as I expected. By divine appointment (on hindsight) I decided to
try and chase after God. The youth fellowship announced that the camp for that year was to
evangelize to some communities in Amasaman. I joined although a bit begrudgingly, and went through the preparation
which included a series of prayer sessions as well as going through the
material to be used for the evangelism. 

It was meticulous and it was turened out to be extreemely helpfulon the field. I joined a day later than everyone else. Our leaders had planned a program which started with a movie show the people showed up and right from day one we had people giving their lives to Christ. The joy and their expressions on their faces was a sight to behold. The daily dawn broadcasts
were also a test of our determination and definitely a test of my Ga speaking skills. The opportunity to
share the word of God in my mother tongue was unique and refreshing; there is definitely no
experience better than praising God in our mother tongue. Later on in the day we would go and preach
the gospel to the communities and teach them about Christ. We would later go back and share our
clothing and goodies we had gathered from church members as well as a medical outreach. This
strategy worked well as we showed them that we were not only interested in their Spiritual welfare
but their holistic welfare as well.

The climax of the whole evangelism was the crusade. We prepared as usual excellently on all fronts.
We formed a wall of prayer around the crusade grounds and the program was hugely successful. Lots
of the inhabitants up until today are grateful for the fact that we shared Christ with them and
testimonies overflowed on our subsequent visits to the communities. I was greatly privileged to see
the hand of God and power of God move in the people I felt greatly privileged to have fulfilled the
great commission that Jesus asked His followers to do upon His leaving the earth.
My life was greatly impacted and I forever cherish the friendships I made and the privilege to impact
lives.
